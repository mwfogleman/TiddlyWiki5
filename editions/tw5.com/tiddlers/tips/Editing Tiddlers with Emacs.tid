title: Editing Tiddlers with Emacs
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Michael Fogleman has written an [[Emacs|http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/]] major mode called [[tid-mode|https://github.com/mwfogleman/tid-mode]], which is for editing TiddlyWiki .tid files. It is derived from text-mode, uses the useful minor modes org-struct and subword, and updates the modified times when you save a .tid file.
